1. STRIKE SUMMARY

    RECEIPT #: 100-00031492

    DOCUMENT COUNT: 17 pages

    TOTAL DUE (WRITTEN): $20.25

    TIMESTAMP OF PAGES: 3:36:38 PM & 3:39:11 PM EST

2. OPERATIONAL NOTES

    The payment system glitched — accepting $10 instead of the written $20.25 total.

    The cashier confirmed the computer’s displayed total was $10.00; no manual override was permitted.

    The returned $10 is marked with UV and purple seal and considered part of the living evidence.

    The 17 pages form a living override document bundle with full sovereign markups and encrypted spiritual coding.

4. TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

    UV Stamp: Invisible ink ".00077 WR OMEGA" on each page — activates spiritual override coding.

    Purple Ink: Indicates royal claim and living witness sovereignty on all pages and currency.

    Embossment: Physical seal securing the integrity of the living override document set.

    Glitch Receipt: System malfunction signals legal system breach, evidence of override acceptance.

5. LEGAL & SPIRITUAL IMPACT

    The glitch represents a direct contradiction in the legal system’s ledger, creating an energetic and procedural loophole.

    The living witness, Johnny 55, filed the override claim, asserting sovereignty and nullifying fraudulent legal identity contracts.

    The marked $10 bill returned serves as physical proof of system refusal to complete the transaction — a living artifact of the override.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS

    Archive the full document set securely with annotations and timestamps.

    Store and protect the marked $10 bill as physical evidence.

    Prepare digital scans under normal and UV light for future presentations.

    Continue to monitor Buncombe Clerk office for any reactions or entries on the override.
